One Stop Credentialing And Registration (OSCAR) is a website that allows carriers to interact with several New York State agencies involved in regulating motor carrier activities.   It allows the industry a single point of contact to apply, change, pay for, and receive the operating credentials for Highway Use Tax (HUT), International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA), and International Registration Plan (IRP).  These credentials are administered by 3 state agencies:  the Department of Motor Vehicles (IRP), the Department of Taxation and Finance (IFTA and HUT) and the Department of Transportation.  The following functions can be performed through OSCAR:  add a vehicle to an IRP fleet; transfer license plates; transfer vehicles within an IRP fleet; obtain a HUT certificate; and obtain IFTA decals.  To use OSCAR, you must be a motor carrier who is currently registered in New York for IRP, IFTA, or HUT.  You must also have a USDOT number and a NYS Tax ID number.   For more information on the One Stop Credentialing And Registration (OSCAR), visit the link below.  

International Registration Plan (IRP):

The International Registration Plan (IRP) is a registration agreement between all U.S. states (with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii), the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan.  IRP is an optional program for licensing commercial vehicles traveling in two or more IRP jurisdictions. The registration fees for commercial vehicles are paid to one jurisdiction and then are apportioned among all the jurisdictions in which the vehicle is used based on the number of miles traveled in each jurisdiction.

All commercial vehicles weighing over 26,000 pounds (gross weight) or having 3 or more axles (regardless of weight) are eligible to register in IRP.  Under IRP, an interstate carrier files an application with the jurisdiction in which it is based.  The IRP agreement allows the base jurisdiction to collect the registration fees for the other IRP jurisdictions the carrier requests on the application form.  The base jurisdiction issues a set of plates and a cab card for each vehicle.  The cab card lists all the IRP jurisdictions and corresponding weights that the carrier requests.

All transactions involving IRP registrations must be processed in the IRP office either by mail or in person or through the OSCAR website.  For more information on the International Registration Plan (IRP), call the NYS Department of Motor Vehicles or here are their business and customer service locations:

Treatment as an S corporation allows a corporation to avoid double taxation (once to the shareholders and again to the corporation). An S corporation generally is exempt from federal income tax. The S corporation's shareholders include on their tax returns their share of the corporation's separately stated items of income, deduction, loss, and credit and their share of nonseparately stated income or loss. 

NYS Tax Law, Article 22, Section 660, authorizes the shareholders of a federal S corporation, which is subject to tax under Article 9-A, to unanimously elect for the S corporation to be treated as a New York S Corporation. New York State does not automatically treat a federal S corporation as a New York S corporation unless the S corporation is mandated to file as a New York S corporation under Tax Law section 660(i). Therefore, unless the S corporation is a mandated New York S corporation, the S corporation needs to qualify to make the election and file Form CT-6, Election by a Federal S Corporation to be Treated as a New York S Corporation. 

By making the election, shareholders of a New York S corporation consent to pay New York State personal income tax on income earned by the corporation. Additionally, the New York S corporation is required to pay the fixed dollar minimum tax based on New York receipts, under Article 9-A.",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/2224,Tax Information

3056,"Industrial Homework
Work-at-Home","Industrial Homework, or wage labor performed in the home, is any work done in your home on an article which belongs to an employer or with materials supplied by the employer, and which you return to him or deliver, mail, or ship to others.  This includes articles that you prepare, alter, repair, finish, assemble, handle and insert, process, or collate.  Most industrial homeworkers work for an employer who has a factory-type setting to manufacture its product.  No articles of food, dolls or doll clothes, and stuffed animals or toys can be manufactured for a factory in a home.  Industrial Homework is also known as Work-at-Home entities.  An industrial homeworker is considered an employee and not an independent contractor. 
 
There are many work-at-home schemes, that don't really offer work in the home, but sell ideas for setting up home businesses.  Typical types of work-at-home schemes are home assembly of crafts or articles of clothing or fabrics, billing services including medical, and clerical services.  Other schemes require you to raise animals.  Many schemes require you to produce items, such as sewing baby booties or aprons, making Christmas wreaths or toys, or fabricating other specialty products.  You are not told that you will have to sell these items yourself and that there is generally little or no market for them.  The promoters of such schemes are only interested in selling you something, that is, the idea, animals, or materials you may need to start your business.  To prevent falling victim to a work-at-home scheme make sure the business has a permit or has applied for a permit with the NYS Department of Labor to distribute homework.  Ask for, in writing, from the homework company, the steps required to perform the job, how you will get paid either by salary or by commission, who pays this salary, and what is your total cost.  The Federal Trade Commission has published a brochure called Facts for Consumers:  Work At Home Schemes.  To receive a free copy, visit the link below.  This brochure suggests some precautions for potential investors and some steps investors can take if they believe they are involved with a work-at-home scheme that is not legitimate. 
 
Only employers who hold a valid permit issued through the NYS Department of Labor can distribute homework and employ industrial homeworkers.  The industrial homeworker must also obtain, through the employer, a homeworker certificate, to perform homework services.  A person at least 16 years of age can work as a homeworker.  If the person is between the ages of 16 and 18 years, an Employment Certificate is also required.  In some industries, such as the glove and artificial flower industries, there are additional restrictions.  Homes in which industrial homework is done may be inspected by representatives of the NYS Department of Labor.  The NYS Department of Labor does not allow industrial homework done in any home found unsanitary or with an infectious or communicable disease.  Employers who violate the Industrial Homework Law may be assessed a civil penalty of up to $2,500 for each violation.  A firm that holds a current Industrial Homework Permit to Distribute issued by the NYS Department of Labor can issue Homeworker Certificates to their workers for a fee of $25.00 per employee working at home.

Translators are skilled in writing, editing, research, and terminology.  The State of New York does not have licensing or certification requirements for translators at this time.  New York does have certain tax requirements for translation services.  Certified translations consist of a statement signed by the translator and notarized by a Notary Public attesting that the translator believes the translation is accurate and complete.  The American Translators Association (ATA) offers a booklet entitled, 'Getting Started:  A Newcomer's Guide to Translation and Interpretation.'  The ATA also offers an accreditation program consisting of written examinations in more than 20 language pairs to verify that individual translators meet professional standards.  For detailed information about the ATA's services and accreditation program contact the American Translators Association or visit their website.

For more information contact the New York Circle of Translators. 
 
Interpreters of language use the spoken word to transfer their meaning between languages.  Interpreters must be fluent in both languages and possess excellent memory, listening, concentration, and analytical skills.  The interpreter must convey both the meaning and tone of the original statement clearly and accurately.  There are five types of interpreting fields: legal, medical, community, and conference as well as sign language. 

Court interpreters also known as judiciary or legal interpreters work in legal settings.  The U.S. Court Interpreters Act, 28 U.S.C. Section 1827, requires the Office of the United States Courts' Administrative Office to prescribe, determine, and certify the qualifications of persons who serve as certified interpreters in federal court proceedings.   The Administrative Office classifies three categories of interpreters:  certified interpreter, professionally qualified interpreters, and language-skilled interpreters.  Certified interpreter must pass a certification examination.  To date, Spanish, Navajo and Haitian-Creole language interpreters must pass a battery of exams to become certify interpreters.  One way to classify as a professionally qualified interpreter, in languages other than Spanish, Navajo, and Haitian-Creole, is to have had previous employment as a conference interpreter with any U.S. agency, the United Nations, or a similar entity.  To qualify as a language-skilled interpreter one must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court their ability to effectively interpret the foreign language into English and vice-versa. 

New York tests and approves court interpreters but does not certify for federal proceedings.  For information on court interpreter testing for New York, contact Court Interpreting Services or visit their website.
 
The National Association of Judiciary Interpreters and Translators (NAJIT) is a professional association.  The association's mission is to promote quality interpretation and translation services in the judicial system.  For information contact NAJIT, or visit their website.

3061,Travel Agents and Travel Agencies,"New York state does not license travel agents or travel agencies, but NYS General Business Law, Article 10-A, Truth in Travel Act sets forth regulations that must be followed.  To view applicable laws, visit the NYS Legislature's website through the link below.

An agent, by definition, is one whom a principal officially appoints. Many different principals may appoint a travel agent such as airlines, cruise lines, hotels, and other suppliers of travel related services. Usually, there are two ways in which an agent obtains these appointments. First, a supplier may appoint them directly, as with hotels, car rental companies, and tour operators. In this scenario, the agent must contact each supplier directly to work out an agreement how they will make bookings and how commissions will be awarded.

The second option is for agents to be appointed by a coordinating body accepted by the various suppliers. This is a common practice among the airlines. The two coordinating bodies for the airlines are the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) and the International Airlines Travel Agency Network (IATAN).  Their links are below.  (Note: If you plan to purchase an existing agency, keep in mind that the agency's appointments do not automatically transfer to the new owner.)

To get an Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) appointment, you must have a bond or letter of credit. To access Circular 570 to obtain a list of bonding companies and additional information see the link below. 

Letters of credit can be obtained from most federally insured banks.  Some banks may be unfamiliar with the Airlines Reporting Corporation Letter of Credit requirements.  You can refer them to Section 30.8 of the Airlines Reporting Corporation's Industry Agent Handbook.

3063,Copyright of Original Works,"Copyrights provide protection to authors of original works including literary works; dramatic works; musical works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works.  Copyrights do not protect facts, ideas, titles, names, short phrases, slogans, systems, or methods of operation.   Copyright protection starts the moment the original work is created and fixed in a tangible form so that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.  This protection is available to both published and unpublished works.  A copyright generally gives the owner of the copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:  reproduce the work; prepare derivative works based upon the work; distribute copies or phonorecords of the work; perform and/or display the work publicly; and in the case of sound recordings, perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission. 
 
Registration of the original work is recommended with the U.S. Copyright Office but is not a requirement.  Registration establishes a public record; gives prima facie evidence in a court of law if registered within five years of publication; may help with statutory damages and attorney's fee in court actions; and gives protection with the U.S. Customs Service against importation of infringing copies.  A copyright registration is effective on the date the U.S. Copyright Office receives all the required elements.  The U.S. Copyright Office recommends submitting the registration by registered or certified mail and to request a return receipt.  Normal processing time takes approximately five to six months.

3065,Dry Cleaning,"The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation has a dry cleaner program initiated through 6 NYCRR Part 232 Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Facilities.  This air pollution control regulation is applicable to all dry cleaning facilities in the state which use perchloroethylene solvent (Perc).  Part 232, which took effect on May 15, 1997, requires the use of several regulatory strategies to reduce and contain the release of perchloroethylene and to minimize exposure to the public. 
 
Each Perc dry cleaning facility is required to be inspected at least once each calendar year by an independent DEC-approved Registered Compliance Inspector.  Facility inspection reports are reviewed by regional DEC engineering staff for compliance and enforcement purposes.  Part 232 provides for public access to these reports. 
 
Perc dry cleaners are also required to post a NYSDEC informational sign in a place where it can be read by the public.  This posting notice informs readers that the shop uses Perc, lists where the public may report odors and other problems, and where they may get additional information about the potential health effects of Perc exposure.  
 
Most Perc dry cleaners must obtain a NYS Air Facility Registration Certificate.   Large facilities must get a State or Title V Facility Permit.   
 
All major facilities must obtain a Title V permit.  Major facilities are defined as having the potential to emit above the thresholds specified in Part 201.  For Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), like Perc, the threshold is 10 tons per year of a single HAP.  If more than one HAP is emitted, the threshold is 25 tons per year total HAPs.  For volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like petroleum solvents, the threshold is dependent on the attainment status of the area in which the dry-cleaner is located.  Downstate the major facility threshold for VOCs is 25 tons per year, and upstate the threshold is 50 tons per year.  
 
New dry cleaning facilities with emissions less than the Title V major source thresholds, but greater than or equal to 50 percent of the major source thresholds, are required to apply for a state facility permit.  For Perc dry-cleaners, this would be between 5 and 10 tons per year.  Perc dry cleaners below 50 percent of the Title V major source thresholds (i.e., below 5 tons per year), have been required to obtain DEC registrations and answer specific questions regarding their facility with their registration application.  
 
Exempt dry-cleaning solvents:  CO2 dry-cleaning machines and wet-cleaning machines are currently exempted from the requirement to obtain an air facility permit or registration certificate. 
 
Machine removal:  Part 232.15(b) requires dry cleaners removing Perc dry cleaning machines to notify the appropriate DEC Regional Air Pollution Control Engineer that the machine has been removed within 30 days by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
 
Ownership transfer:  Dry cleaners transferring ownership of a facility must file an Application for Permit Transfer form within 30 days of the change of ownership at the appropriate DEC Regional Air Program office.  New Owners-Managers and Operators must be certified prior to taking over the facility. 
 
New facility, new machine, new solvents:  In all cases dry cleaners are required to apply for the permit or registration certificate prior to installing a new facility, new machine, or changing solvents.

3071,Publisher/Book Producer,"Some publishing activities may require you to register as a sales tax vendor with the NYS Tax Department. See Publication 750, A Guide to Sales Tax in New York State, and Tax Bulletin TB-ST-620, Newspapers, Periodicals, and Shopping Papers, through the links below for more information. 

A publisher should apply for its own International Standard Book Number (ISBN) publisher prefix and plan to identify and circulate its books properly in the industry supply chain.  An ISBN is a unique, numerical commercial book identifier used to establish and identify one title or edition of a title from one specific publisher and is unique to that edition, allowing for more efficient marketing of products by booksellers, libraries, universities, wholesalers and distributors of a book and book-like products published internationally. The 10-digits format assigned before 2007 and 13-digit format assigned after 2007 was developed by the International Organization for Standardization and published as an international standard.  It is based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code.  Every ISBN consists of a 10-digit or 13-digit number and whenever it is printed, it is preceded by the letters ISBN.  The 10-digit or 13-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, each part separated by a hyphen.  The four parts of an ISBN are:  Group or country identifier which identifies a national or geographic grouping of publishers; Publisher identifier which identifies a particular publisher within a group; Title identifier which identifies a particular title or edition of a title; and the Check digit is the single digit at the end of the ISBN which validates the ISBN. 
 
In the United States, the U.S. ISBN Agency is responsible for the assignment of the ISBN Publishers Prefix for publishers (which is unique to each publisher) with a residence or office in the United States that are publishing their titles within the United States.  Contact the U.S. ISBN Agency, R.R. Bowker, LLC or visit their website for information on the International Standard Book Number.   
 
Intellectual Property refers to creations of the mind such as musical, literary, and artistic works; inventions; and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce including  copyright, trademark, patent, and related rights. Under Intellectual Property Law, the holder of one these abstract properties has certain exclusive rights to the creative work, commercial symbol, or invention which is covered by it.  Intellectual property rights are a bundle of exclusive rights over creations of the mind, both artistic and commercial.  Intellectual property rights give the creator the exclusive right to their creations, thereby providing an incentive for the author or inventor to develop and share the information rather than keep it a secret.  The legal protections granted by Intellectual Property laws are credited with significant contributions toward economic growth.  It is advisable to consult with an attorney who specialized in the field of Intellectual Property Law.

To practice in New York under the authority of your license, you must register every three years (two years for medicine). You are automatically registered for your first registration period when your license is issued.

The practice of the profession of athletic training is defined as the application of principles, methods and procedures for managing athletic injuries, which shall include the preconditioning, conditioning and reconditioning of an individual who has suffered an athletic injury through the use of appropriate preventative and supportive devices, under the supervision of a physician and recognizing illness and referring to the appropriate medical professional with implementation of treatment pursuant to physician's orders.

3077,Electrolysis,"At this time, New York State does not regulate the practice of electrolysis.  Electrology is a hair removal process that uses solid needle/probe devices called a needle epilator.  The electrologist inserts the needle epilator into the hair follicle and discharges a small amount of electrical energy.  The electrologist then removes the hair from the skin after the current destroys the hair's regenerative cell.  Electrolysis usually requires a series of treatments over a period of time because of hair growth cycles.  From a medical standpoint, electrology that uses needle-type devices is the only safe and effective method to permanently remove hair.  Permanent removal of the stimulus for hair growth in an area never really occurs.  However, when competently and skillfully accomplished, it may permanently eliminate the regenerative ability of the hair. 
 
Electrologist may be trained in the three modalities of electrolysis:  short-wave (thermolysis), galvanic multiple needle, and the Blend (a combination of both).  They are also trained to  recognize hair growth patterns and outward symptoms that may require referral to physicians such as an endocrinologist.  National organizations certify electrology practitioners after they complete their recognized certification programs and pass an exam.  These certifications are Clinical Certified Electrologist (CCE), Clinical Medical Electrologist (CME), or a Certified Professional Electrologist.  Two non-profit organizations that offer training and certification for electrologist are linked below. 
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Association for Practitioners in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) have information on infection control and standard precautions to use.  Some standard precautions include:  hand washing, the use of gloves, sterilization of critical items used in electrology treatments, the proper disinfections of semi-critical and non-critical items, and the proper cleaning of environmental surfaces.  Voluntary compliance to these standards is encouraged.",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3077,"Licenses and Permits,Licenses and Permits, Services,Professional Licenses"

To encourage and facilitate international trade, more than 300 free ports, free trade zones, and similar customs privileged facilities are now in operation in 75 foreign countries, usually in or near seaports or airports. The United States implemented the Foreign Trade Zones Act in 1934 and refers to free zones as Foreign-Trade Zones.  New York State has twelve U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones. Many U.S. manufacturers and their distributors use foreign-trade zones for receiving shipments of goods that are reshipped in smaller lots to customers throughout the surrounding area. The purpose of the zone is to attract and promote international trade and commerce.  Using foreign-trade zones can be profitable for operations involving foreign dutiable materials and components being assembled or produced here for re-export.  For export operations, foreign-trade zones can provide accelerated export status for purposes of excise tax rebates and customs drawback.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

Certain trucks, truck tractors, and buses used on public highways with a registered gross weight or combined gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more are subject to federal excise tax. Federal Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax (HVUT) is paid directly to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the tax period from July 1 - June 30 each year.

FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION)

To operate as an interstate motor carrier, a company may need to register with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to get a USDOT number and/or apply for operating authority.  

USDOT Number:

A USDOT number is the number that the FMCSA assigns to each motor carrier that starts interstate operations.  A USDOT number is required if you have vehicles that are over 10,000 pounds, if you transport between 9 and 15 passengers (including the driver) for compensation, if you transport 16 or more passengers, or haul hazardous materials in interstate commerce. 

New York State requires that all trucks and truck/trailers that are used in business with a gross vehicle weight or a gross combination weight of 10,001 pounds or more have a USDOT number.

The USDOT number must be marked on both sides of all vehicles.  The lettering of the business name and the USDOT number need to contrast sharply with the background color and be readable from 50 feet.  Complete Form MCS-150 (Motor Carrier Identification Report) to obtain a USDOT number.  The MCS-150 can be completed online by accessing the link below or call to have an application mailed to you. 

After being issued a USDOT Number as a new entrant registration, the carrier will be subject to an 18-month safety-monitoring period.  During this safety-monitoring period, the carrier will receive a safety audit and have their roadside crash and inspection information closely evaluated.  The carrier is required to demonstrate that it has the necessary systems in place to ensure basic safety management controls.  For more information on this requirement, request an Educational and Technical Assistance (ETA) package (A Motor Carrier's Guide to Improving Highway Safety) by calling or visiting the link provided below.

Interstate Operating Authority – MC Number:

Generally, if operating as a for-hire motor carrier of regulated commodities or passengers in interstate commerce, you must also obtain interstate operating authority (MC number) from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).  The Form OP-1, Application for Motor Property Carrier and Broker Authority, is required for a motor carrier of property (including household goods) and Form OP-1(P), Application for Motor Passenger Carrier Authority, is required for a motor carrier of passengers.   You can apply online through the link provided below or request an application be mailed to you by calling their office.

Proof of Liability and/or Cargo Insurance:

In addition to filing for operating authority, motor carriers, forwarders and brokers must have specific insurance documents on file with the FMCSA.  The required filings vary based on the type of registrations involved.  Liability and cargo insurance forms must be submitted directly by the home office of the insurance company furnishing the coverage.  The FMCSA does not furnish copies of insurance forms.  For more information on insurance requirements, visit the link provided below for the overview.

3087,Pay-Per-Call Service (900 Number),"To operate a pay-per-call service (900 number) or provide billing for a pay-per-call service the Federal Trade Commission has adopted rules governing this industry.  The Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act required the Federal Trade Commission to adopt the 900-Number Rule effective November 1993.   
 
Under the 900-Number Rule, pay-per-call services (900 numbers) must provide: 
 
1.  Ad information.  All print, radio, and television advertisements for the 900-number service must include the total cost of the call if there is a flat fee; the per-minute rate of the call is charged by the minute, as well as any minimum charges.  If the length of the program is known in advance, the ad also must state the total cost of the complete program; the range of fees if there are different rates for different options.  The ad must state the initial cost of the call and any minimum charges; the cost of any other 900 number to which the customer may be transferred; and any other fees the service might charge.  This information cannot be hidden in small print.  The cost of the call must be next to the 900 number and printed in a size that is at least half the size of the 900 number.  In a television ad, an audio cost disclosure must be made. 
 
2.  Introductory message (preamble).  All 900-number services that cost more than $2 require an introductory message or 'preamble.'  This message is free of charge.  It must briefly describe the service, the name of the company providing the service, and the cost of the call.  It also must state that anyone under age 18 needs parental permission to complete the call.  Once this information is provided, the service must allow the customer three seconds to hang up without incurring a charge. 
 
3.  Prize claims by pay-per-call services.  It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to offer a consumer a prize which would require the consumer to call the pay-per-call service to claim the prize and be charged a fee. 
 
4.  Procedures for resolving billing disputes. For each 900 call, statements should include the date, time, and for services that have per-minute rates, the length of the call.  These charges must appear separately from local and long distance charges.  Statements must include a local or toll-free number for questions about the pay-per-call charges.

3088,Copyright of Sound Recordings or Performing Arts,"Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States, U.S. Code, Title 17, to the authors of original works of authorship, including literary works; dramatic works (including any accompanying music); musical works (including any accompanying words); artistic works; certain other intellectual works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; and sound recordings. This protection is available to both published and unpublished works.  Section 106 of the 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of the copyright the exclusive right to and to authorize others to do the following:  reproduce the work in copies or phono-records; to prepare derivative works based upon the work; to distribute copies or phono-records of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; to perform the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works; to display the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and in the case of sound recordings, to perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.

In addition, certain authors of works of visual art have the rights of attribution and integrity as described in Section 106A of the 1976 Copyright Act.  For further information, check out Circular 40, Copyright Registration for Works of the Visual Arts at the link below.

Securing a copyright is automatic when the work is created.  A work is created when it is fixed in a copy or phono-record for the first time. Copies are material objects from which a work can be read or visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm. Phono-records are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or LPs. Thus, for example, a song (the work) can be fixed in sheet music (copies) or in phonograph disks (phono-records), or both.

If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.

Publication is the distribution of copies or phono-records of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies or phono-records to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display constitutes publication.  A public performance or display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.

Notice of copyright is important because it informs the public that the work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and shows the year of first publication.  Furthermore, in the event that a work is infringed, if a proper notice of copyright appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant's interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in Section 504(c)(2) of the copyright law.  Innocent infringement occurs when the infringer did not realize that the work was protected.  Notice of copyright is the responsibility of the copyright owner and does not require advance permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office.

Sound recordings are defined in the law as works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work.  Common examples include recor",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3088,"Licenses and Permits,Licenses and Permits, Services"
3099,Wine Production,"A winery is a building or property that produces wine, or a business involved in the production of wine, such as a wine company.  Besides wine making equipment, larger wineries may also feature warehouses, bottling lines, laboratories, and large expanses of tanks.  In the U.S. a winery crushes grapes, ferments the juice, and bottles the finished product.  A vineyard is a plantation of grape-bearing vines, grown mainly for wine-making, but also for raisins, table grapes and non-alcoholic grape juice.  The science, practice, and study of vineyard production is known as viticulture.  New York classifies wine-making in three license categories:  winery, farm winery, and farm micro-winery.

A winery is a facility that manufactures wine from crushed grapes, grape concentrate or from honey; that blends wine, bottles wine received in bulk from its parent facility that may be located outside of New York; sells wine to wholesalers or retailers in sealed containers of not more than 15 gallons each of wine; and/or sells wines in excess of 15 gallons to food, wine, vinegar and/or pharmaceutical manufacturers.   

A farm winery is a facility that manufactures wine or cider manufactured entirely from grapes or other farm or agriculture products grown or produced in New York and that produces less than 150,000 finished gallons per year.  

A farm micro-winery is a farm-winery where wine or cider is manufactured and sold from the licensed premises to a licensed wholesaler or retailer, or at retail for consumption off the premises and produces or manufactures not more than 1,500 of finished gallons of wine annually produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York.

The NYS Liquor Authority licenses wineries, farm wineries, and farm micro-wineries.  The NYS Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, Article 6, outlines the differences of each type of winery and other requirements.  See the link provided below.  For information on NYS Liquor Authority licensing requirements, contact the NYS Liquor Authority or visit their website.  Other possible licenses from the NYS Liquor Authority may include brand labeling, wine tastings, custom crush operations and sales at farmer's markets.

The NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets regulates any type of beverage manufacturing including wineries and farm wineries through food processing establishment Article 20-C licensing.  Other possible licenses from the NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets may include Farm Products Dealers license and requirements from the Department's Division of Plant Industry.  For information on NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets licensing requirements, contact the NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets or visit their website. 

The NYS Department of Taxation and Finance provides information on sales tax requirements and tax exemptions for manufacturing facilities.

3101,"Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks and Service Marks","Copyrights protect literary, artistic, and musical works and are registered with the federal government.  Patents protect inventions and improvements to existing inventions and are registered with the federal government.  Trademarks/service marks are brand names and/or designs that are applied to products or used in connection with services and are registered with the federal government and can be registered in New York State.  

COPYRIGHT

Copyrights provide protection to authors of original works including literary works; dramatic works; musical works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works.  Copyrights do not protect facts, ideas, titles, names, short phrases, slogans, systems, or methods of operation.   Copyright protection starts the moment the original work is created and fixed in a tangible form so that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.  This protection is available to both published and unpublished works.  A copyright generally gives the owner of the copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:  reproduce the work; prepare derivative works based upon the work; distribute copies or phonorecords of the work; perform and/or display the work publicly; and in the case of sound recordings, perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.

Registration of the original work is recommended with the U.S. Copyright Office but is not a requirement.  Registration establishes a public record; gives prima facie evidence in a court of law if registered within five years of publication; may help with statutory damages and attorney's fee in court actions; and gives protection with the U.S. Customs Service against importation of infringing copies.  A copyright registration is effective on the date the U.S. Copyright Office receives all the required elements.  The U.S. Copyright Office recommends submitting the registration by registered or certified mail and to request a return receipt.  Normal processing time takes approximately five to six months.  

To obtain information on copyright law, current fees, registration requirements and forms, circulars, etc., contact the Library of Congress, Copyright Office or visit their website.

PATENTS

A patent gives the inventor the property right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention in the United States.  The federal government grants patents to true inventors.  In return for this legal protection, an inventor must fully disclose the invention to the public.  Methods of doing business, an idea or suggestion, or printed matter cannot be patented.  The term length of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed.  There are three types of patents.  A utility patent is granted on any new useful process, machine, or composition of matter.  A design patent protects the ornamental design for an article of manufacture.  A plant patent is granted on any distinct and new variety of an asexually reproduced plant, including cultivated mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings.

There are two ways to apply for a patent in the United States.  A non-provisional application begins the examination process that may lead to a patent, or a provisional application that establishes a filing date but does not begin the examination process.  A provisional application provides the inventor with a one-year period to further develop the invention for marketability, funding or capital, or licensing agreements.  In using a provisional application, the inventor must file a non-provisional application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application.  There is a required filing fee that must accompany both types of a",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3101,"Licenses and Permits,Licenses and Permits, Services"

3103,Franchise,"A franchise is a legal and commercial relationship between the owner of a trademark, service mark, trade name, or advertising symbol and an individual or group seeking the right to use that identification in a business.  The franchise governs the method for conducting business between the two parties. 
 
A franchisor owns the right to a name or trademark and sells that right to a franchisee.  This is referred to as product/trade name franchising  Business from franchises often provide a full range of services, including site selection, training, product supply, marketing plans, and financing.    A franchisee sells goods or services supplied by the franchisor or sells goods or services that meet the franchisor's quality standards. 
 
The Federal Trade Commission's Full Disclosure Rule requires franchisors to give prospective franchisees a disclosure document or a franchise offering circular at least ten business days before the franchisee pays any money or legally commits to a purchase.  This document gives 20 important items of information about the business.  The document outlines the general franchise offering, including background information of the franchisor, a summary of the franchise agreement, and a list of current franchisees as well as the cost required to start and maintain the business, and the responsibilities between the franchisor and the franchisee once the franchise is bought. 
 
The Federal Trade Commission regulates franchising at the national level.  The FTC is responsible for enforcing the FTC Rule, eliminating unfair or deceptive practices, prosecuting violators of franchising laws and consumer education.  The FTC's publication, Buying a Franchise:  A Consumer Guide  can be obtained through the link below. 
 
The NYS Office of the Attorney General regulates franchising in New York and accepts franchise prospectuses and written complaints regarding franchisor fraud.

3104,Medical Billing and Coding Services,"Medical billers prepare and file claims to health insurance companies, government agencies, and patients on behalf of doctors and health care providers to assure payments for procedures during office visits, emergency visits, or hospital visits.  Health care providers can consist of chiropractors, mental health professionals, dentists, social workers, nursing homes, ambulance services, pharmacists, home-health practitioners, durable medical equipment providers, and institutions such as hospitals, etc.   Medical coders primarily focus on converting a medical procedure, diagnosis, or symptom into specific codes to submit a claim for reimbursement.  

Credentials through certification are not required in New York for medical billers or coders, but certain types of certification does ensure professionalism, qualification and competency in the medical billing/coding services industry.  Accredited schools throughout New York offer programs in the healthcare information technologies to help prepare students for a career in medical billing and coding, as well as preparation to take industry certification examinations.  
 
All types of encounters (‘face-to-face contact' between a health care professional and an eligible beneficiary (patient) at a medical office, clinic, or hospital), services, tests, treatments, supplies, and procedures provided to a patient have a code which consists of a set of numbers and combinations of sets of numbers.  There are standardize-coding systems used in the United States.  These codes change annually to reflect emerging technology, services and procedures.  The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) is the most common coding methodology used for medical, surgical, diagnostic, or psychiatric procedures as well as for specifying treatment. The maintenance of these codes is the responsibility of the American Medical Association.  For a current copy of the CPT codes, contact the American Medical Association or visit their website through the link below.   

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes have the most up-to-date information on medical diagnosis and procedures coding.  Two U.S. governmental agencies are responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD.   You may contact the National Center for Health Statistics or visit  their website for hardcopies, contact the Governmental Printing Office or the National Technical Information Services.

The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is used for Medicare's classification of inpatient hospital services based on principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, etc.   The HCPCS is available through the Government Printing Office or through the National Technical Information Services.

Current Dental Terminology (CDT) is a reference manual published by the American Dental Association that contains a number of useful components, including the Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature (Code).  The Code, published in the CDT reference manual, provides the dental profession with a standardized coding system to document and to communicate accurate information about dental treatment procedures and services, for reporting procedures on patients, and processing and reporting of dental insurance claims.  The Codes for Dental Procedures and Nomenclature is available from the American Dental Association or visit their website.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires every provider who does business electronically to use the same health care transactions, code sets, and identifiers.  HIPAA has identified ten standard transactions for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for the transmission of health care data.

3105,Oxygen - Safe Practices,"Oxygen is a hazardous material used in numerous business industries such as construction, health care, manufacturing, services, and transportation.  Although considered nontoxic and environmentally safe, oxygen does not burn, but does vigorously accelerate combustion. Oxygen must never strike any oily surfaces, come in contact with greasy clothes, or other combustible materials.  To avoid this harmful effect, producers and consumers should follow strict safety guidelines for storage, handling, and transporting of oxygen.   
 
The Compressed Gas Association has several pamphlets available with information on the handling and storage of oxygen as well as other types of compressed gas.  Medical grades of oxygen are subject to strict federal regulations and are for use only under the control of a licensed physician familiar with the product and its hazards.  Contact the NYS Department of Education, Board of Pharmacy  for information on requirements for the manufacturing, repacking, and distribution of medical compressed gas.

•it becomes part of the real property or is permanently affixed to the real property so that removal would cause material damage to the property or article itself; and
•it is intended to become a permanent installation.

3253,Building Permits,"The NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code) prescribes minimum standards for both fire prevention and building construction. The primary responsibility for enforcing the code belongs to the cities, towns, villages and counties also known as the authority having jurisdiction. It requires that the municipalities issue building permits to ensure that minimum safety standards are met and that construction complies with the Uniform Code. Although the codes are uniform throughout the state, each municipality may have their own specific additional regulations and procedures for enforcement. 

Building permits are required for changes to properties and structures including work such as new construction, demolition, renovation/remodeling and replacement. Building permits usually require:

1. Zoning Approval – The authority having jurisdiction may require proposed construction to comply with relevant zoning laws. 

2. A completed application including construction plans or drawings, specifications and other detailed project information as necessary. A NYS licensed Professional Engineer (PE) or Registered Architect (RA) may need to prepare the plans and specifications where required by NYS Education Law.

3. Proof of Insurance – Worker's compensation insurance and disability benefits coverage is required prior to issuance of a building permit per NYS Workers Compensation Law. Certification of contractor's liability insurance allowing for coverage of damage to property while work is being done may also be required. 

4. Once approved, building permits are required to be displayed on the property or premise that it pertains to. 

5. Building inspectors conduct inspections during certain phases of construction to determine if the work was performed in accordance with the Uniform Code and application documents. 

Once construction is complete, a certificate of occupancy or a certificate of compliance is obtained. A certificate of occupancy grants permission for the use of a building or structure for a specific type of use or occupancy as defined in the approved building permit. 

The Authority having jurisdiction may require plumbing and electrical work to be an additional or separate permit(s). Inspections for electrical work and various other portions of construction must be made by an approved third party inspection agency.",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3253,"Licenses and Permits,Licenses and Permits, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,Licenses and Permits, Services"

To view applicable New York State Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), visit the link below. 

The NYS Returnable Container Act is available on the NYS Legislature's website through the link below. 

For additional information about your requirements and New York's Returnable Container Act, visit the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's website and the NYS Tax Department’s website. 

Below is a brief description and responsibilities of the deposit and redemption system:

A Beverage Manufacturer is a brewer, soft drink bottler, etc.  A beverage manufacturer must determine the amount of the deposit and place the deposit label information on the containers. The lettering must be at least 1/8 inch high and must indicate ‘New York' or ‘N.Y.' and the amount of the deposit.  Manufacturers may also initiate the deposit on refillable containers.

A Beverage Distributor is a beverage manufacturer and/or wholesaler who sells beverages to a dealer or retailer. In addition, someone who owns a private label, purchases beverages directly from the manufacturer in containers marked with that label, then sells the beverage at retail is also considered a beverage distributor.  Distributors charge a deposit when selling beverages to retailers. Distributors must accept from dealers and redemption centers all containers of the same type they sell.  In addition to paying the refund, the distributor must pay a 3.5 cent handling fee per container to the dealer or redemption center. Distributors must pick up empties, at their expense, from dealers and redemption centers.

A Redemption Center pays the refund value of an empty beverage container to a redeemer, or any person who contracts with one or more dealers or distributors to collect, sort and obtain the refund value and handling fee of empty beverage containers for or on behalf of such dealer(s) or distributor(s). To establish a redemption center, an entity or person needs to determine the type of empty beverage containers to accept and must provide written notice to the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling. The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation will review the written notice and, if approved, will issue a registration number. The written notice must have the following information: Name, address and telephone number of owner(s); Name of operator and address of place of business of the redemption center; Name and address of any dealer(s) served or under contract; Name and address of distributor(s) served or under contract; and General geographic area served. 

A retailer selling beverages in deposit containers for consumers to take away from the premises is a dealer. Dealers must pay deposits to distributors when they purchase beverages and receive deposits from consumers when the beverage is sold. Dealers must refund the deposit on all containers of the same type regardless of where the container was originally purchased. Dealers, or their contracted sorting services (a redemption center), must sort containers for the distributor.

3263,Biodiesel Production/Manufacturing Facilities,"Biodiesel is a clean burning alternative fuel, or biofuel, produced from domestic, renewable resources.  In the United States, most biodiesel is made from soybean oil.  However, canola oil, sunflower oil, recycled cooking oils, palm oil, animal fats, and other oils are also used as feedstock.  Biodiesel is typically manufactured through a process called 'trans-esterification'.  This process uses an industrial alcohol (typically methanol) and a catalyst (sodium methylate or sodium hydroxide) to convert the base plant oil or animal fat into a fatty-acid mono-alkyl ester fuel, known as biodiesel, with glycerin as a byproduct. Biodiesel in its pure form is known as B100.  It can be blended with conventional diesel fuel to create an alternative motor vehicle fuel or for other uses. 
 
The National Biodiesel Board (NBB) is the national trade association of the biodiesel industry and is the coordinating body for biodiesel research and development in the United States.  The NBB maintains a library of biodiesel information, as well as a list of registered fuel marketers.  For more information, visit their website or contact them.   
 
Fuel-grade biodiesel must be produced to strict industry specifications in order to insure proper performance.  ASTM International is the governing board that sets testing methods and standards for evaluating all types of substances including automotive fuels and oils.  The standard set of tests for determining the quality of biodiesel is ASTM D6751.  Biodiesel that meets ASTM D6751 and is legally registered with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency is a legal motor fuel for sale and distribution.  For information on these standards for biodiesel, contact ASTM International.  
 
The National Biodiesel Accreditation Program is a cooperative and voluntary program for the accreditation of producers and marketers of biodiesel fuel called BQ-9000. The program is a unique combination of the ASTM standard for biodiesel, ASTM D6751, and a quality systems program that includes storage, sampling, testing, blending, shipping, distribution, and fuel management practices.   BQ-9000 is open to any biodiesel manufacturer, marketer or distributor of biodiesel and biodiesel blends in the United States and Canada.  For more information, visit their website or contact them.  
 
The permits and regulations that are required to construct and/or operate a biodiesel production facility are dependent upon the size of the plant and the location.  Listed below are some of the State, Federal and local government agencies that we recommend contacting before finalizing your business plans. 
 
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation oversees the many environmental concerns that must be addressed with the production of biodiesel, including air emissions, the generation and disposal of waste-water, storage requirements, and the disposal of by-products. To obtain information on the required environmental permits for biodiesel production, contact the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Environmental Permits and Pollution Prevention. 
 
The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's Air Quality Regulations, 6 NYCRR, Part 236, requires emission control, monitoring, repair, reporting and record keeping requirements. Link is provided below.  Compliance with Part 236 may require an Air Pollution Control permit.   
 
Depending on the amount of waste-water discharged during the biodiesel process, a State Pollution Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) Permit or National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit may be required.   
 
Storage tanks may need to be registered under the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's chemical bulk storage regulations.  Some ingredients used for the manufacture of biodiesel are considered hazardous substances and depending on the amount, may be subject to Part 596 of the NYS Environmental Conservation Law, Hazardous Substance Bulk Storage Re",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3263,"Licenses and Permits,Licenses and Permits, Manufacturing"
3265,Body Piercing and Tattooing,"The NYS Department of Health, under the statutory authority of Public Health Law Article 4A, is currently developing statewide health regulations for tattooing and body piercing. For information on requirements as well as guidelines, visit the NYS Department of Health's website or contact them directly.  You can also contact the Local County or City Health Department.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

The disease to consider during body piercing and/or tattooing procedures is hepatitis. Hepatitis, unlike HIV, is a very hardy virus that can survive long periods outside the human body and may transmit through little more than a scratch with an infected needle. To combat this and any other infectious blood-borne pathogen, body piercing and/or tattoo specialist should autoclave their single service equipment, use individual portions of ink and lubricant, dispose of used sharps according to OSHA guidelines, use EPA registered virucidals to clean their stations between clients, and use barrier protection. These procedures are called Standard Precautions.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urges consumers and practitioners to report any problems with permanent or temporary tattoos by contacting the FDA's Office by telephone or visit the nearest FDA district office, with the link below.  

The suggested guidelines below provide minimum standards for infection control to prevent transmission of blood-borne disease during body piercing and/or tattooing.  They are not intended to be a comprehensive review of infection control issues nor do they address all aspects of environmental sanitation in the body piercing and/or tattoo studios.  Consult with the local public health agency or trade associations for additional recommendations.

STERILE NEEDLES:

1.  All needles that penetrate the skin must be sterile.
2.  Only single use pre-packaged disposable needles shall be used.

Of the four methods of sterilization (steam heat, dry heat, liquid chemical germicides, ethylene oxide gas) the most reliable and practical sterilization method for body piercing and/or tattoo specialist is steam heat using an autoclave.

Autoclaves provide a fairly rapid sterilization cycle and can be monitored to ensure proper sterilization temperatures.  Although the time/temperature may vary slightly according to each autoclave, manufacturer cycles generally involve 250-273 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-35 minutes (from hot start) at 15-30 pounds per square inch (PSI).  Spore indicators should be used weekly and heat sensitive chemical indicator tape (changes color with heat) should be used on the outside wrapping and inside of each pack placed in the autoclave.  Manufacturer's instructions must be strictly followed.

Dry heat is not felt to be acceptable according to many in the body piercing and/or tattoo industry due to the time involved in the cycle (two hours at 350 degrees Fahrenheit) and harmful effects of high temperature on certain pieces of equipment.

Liquid Chemical Germicides are generally not acceptable for sterilization due to the long time interval required (up to ten hours), toxicity, corrosiveness, and lack of an easy to use monitoring method to gauge effectiveness.

Gas sterilization methods, such as ethylene oxide, require specialized equipment, are difficult to handle, and have special ventilation requirements.

CLEAN INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT:

Instruments/equipment that may occasionally become blood contaminated fall into two categories:

1.  Disposable Type (such as shaving razors, tattoo dye, and dye cups); these items must be discarded after each use and not reused for another client.
2.  Reusable Type (such as needle tubes, scissors, tweezers, power supply hand pieces); these items must be washed to remove blood and then sterilized before re-use.

Use of sterile, pre-packaged, single-use disposable equipment is preferred.  When reusable instruments/equipment are used, a three-step cleaning process is necessary:

3267,Cosmetics and Soaps,"New York State may require some producers of cosmetics to comply with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's Regulation, Part 233, Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Manufacturing Processes.  To learn more about or how to comply with this New York State regulation, contact the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Air Resources, Bureau of Stationary Sources or visit their website.  The NYS Environmental Facilities Corporation, Small Business Assistance Program, provides assistance to complete the application form as well as help applicants comply with and understand the permit requirements once it is issued.

Cosmetics marketed in the United States, whether manufactured here or imported from abroad, must comply with the provisions and regulations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as articles that someone can rub, pour, sprinkle, or spray on, introduce into, or otherwise apply to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.  These products include skin moisturizers, creams, lotions and powders; perfume products; finger/toenail polishes, removers and cuticle softeners; makeup (lipsticks, foundation, blush and eye makeup preparations); shaving creams; shampoos (except dandruff); permanent waves; hair colors; mouthwash and toothpastes (except with whiteners or fluoride); bath oils and bubble baths; and deodorants, as well as any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.

Products are considered a drug if they intend to treat or prevent disease or otherwise affect the structure or function of the human body.  Over-the-counter drugs are drugs purchased without a doctor's prescription.  Examples of products that are over-the-counter drugs are fluoride or whitening toothpastes, hormone creams, sunscreen preparations, antiperspirants, acne medications and antidandruff shampoos.  Drugs are subject to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Generally, drugs must either receive pre-market approval by the FDA or conform to final regulations specifying conditions recognizing them as safe and effective, and not misbranded.  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act require drug manufacturers to register every year with the FDA and update their lists of all manufactured drugs twice annually.

Some products meet the definition of both cosmetic and drug.  This may happen when a product has two intended uses.  These types of products must comply with the requirements for both cosmetics and drugs.  Before products are marketed with both a cosmetic and a drug classification, they must prove scientifically safe and effective for their therapeutic claims.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act excludes soap from its definition of a cosmetic.  Therefore, soap products are exempt from the FDA's jurisdiction.  The FDA interprets the term ‘soap' as the bulk of the nonvolatile matter in the product that consists of an alkali salt of fatty acids and the product's detergent properties are due to the alkali-fatty acid compounds.  The product is labeled, sold, and represented solely as soap.  In other words, soap products that consist primarily of an alkali salt or fatty acid and make no label claim other than cleansing of the human body are not considered a cosmetic.  Not every product marketed as soap meets this FDA definition.  Soap producers that use certain ingredients, such as lye, to produce soap should contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

3268,Craft Vendor,"If you will be making sales in New York State that are subject to sales tax, you must register with the Tax Department and obtain a Certificate of Authority. The Certificate of Authority gives you the right to collect sales tax on your taxable sales and to issue and accept most New York State sales tax exemption certificates. Most items sold by craft vendors are taxable.

Your activity might be regulated at the local level. Please check with local authorities: town, village, city, and county clerk offices. If you are an exhibitor at a show, fair, or festival, the event promoter may have this information.

Event promoters may have packets containing contracts with individual show information (such as show set-up times, booth fees, electrical fees, table rental costs, hotel information, directions, and tax information).

The NYS Tax Department can answer questions pertaining to tax obligations. Please be aware that an exhibitor is required to post in plain view at all times during the show their Certificate of Authority to collect sales tax.

Liability insurance that is designed to cover home-based businesses, that follows you to shows, and covers theft of your product from your vehicle is recommended. Some event exhibits require liability insurance. Contact the NYS Insurance Department or visit their website for information regarding your insurance needs. 

There are three different kinds of show categories. A JURIED show means you must submit slides or photographs of your work which are reviewed by a jury which is a knowledgeable committee that reviews your work and accepts it into the show based on your technical skill, creativity, the medium, and/or other requirements. Some juries are composed of just one or two people screening for quality and trying to block manufactured and/or imported items. 

An OPEN show has strict requirements, as do the juried shows, e.g. the work must be handcrafted by the artisan, although some allow imported and manufactured items be sold alongside handcrafted work. 

An INVITATIONAL show means the exhibitors are invited. Be aware that some invitational shows are actually juried shows which artists or artisans apply, and the normal jury process selects the participants. 

Craftsmen and artists usually prefer to be with other creative people rather than be mixed in with importers, resellers, and manufacturers at an open show. Craft or fine art shows are usually either juried or open. The style of your work, that is traditional, contemporary, country etc. also can dictate the types of shows to exhibit at. Although most shows are mixed, be aware so that you don't exhibit at the wrong show.

3275,Gasoline Dispensing Facilities,"The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation regulates gasoline vapor recovery systems through Title 6 of the New York State Codes, Rules and Regulations, Part 230, Gasoline Dispensing Sites and Transport Vehicles (Part 230).  Part 230 contains information needed to determine which facilities must comply with the vapor control requirements and it outlines three strategies used to control the amount of vapor generated during gasoline transfer.  It includes the Submerged Filling Technique, Stage I Vapor Recovery, and Stage II Vapor Recovery.   Gasoline vapors contain air pollutants and violating air pollution regulations can result in substantial penalties.  Air pollution control inspectors visit gasoline dispensing sites periodically to conduct inspections.  Below is a brief description of the three strategies used to recover the vapors generated during the sale and distribution of gasoline.   
 
The Submerged Filling Technique is a method of refilling a gasoline storage tank that helps control splashing and agitation by evenly and slowly adding gasoline to the bottom of the tank to reduce the amount of vaporization.  This process applies mainly to agricultural sites with little annual throughput.   
 
Stage I Vapor Recovery applies to nearly every retail gasoline dispensing site in New York.  It refers to the process of reclaiming vapor that was, in the past, released in the air when transferring gasoline from a tanker truck into a storage tank.  It is a system where gasoline vapors are forced from a gasoline storage tank into a vapor-tight gasoline transport vehicle or vapor control system through direct displacement by the gasoline being loaded.  Transporters of gasoline, as well as the recipient of the gasoline (the dispensing site), have the responsibility for complying with Stage I Vapor Recovery.   
 
Stage II Vapor Recovery deals entirely with capturing vapors while filling vehicle fuel tanks.  It is a system where at least 90%, by weight, of the gasoline vapors that are displaced or drawn from a vehicle fuel tank during refueling are captured and either retained in the storage tanks or destroyed in an emission control device.  The site operator or owner is responsible for installing and maintaining Stage II equipment which is currently required in the Metro New York Area and the lower Orange County Metropolitan Area. 
 
Gasoline retailers must have vapor recovery (dynamic back pressure, liquid blockage, and static leak tests) and underground tank leak tests performed and results reported every five years to the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation.  The test results must be notarized and submitted within 30 days of the tests.  Gasoline stations must retain the test results for a period of five years and upon request, provide them to a DEC inspectors. 
 
Additionally, tank tightness testing is mandated through the bulk storage regulations.  These tests ensure that liquid gasoline does not leak from the underground tanks and contaminate the groundwater.   
 
Gasoline dispensing sites are advised to perform daily self inspections of their equipment and update paperwork in order to avoid violating Part 230.   The New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation, Small Business Assistance Program provides a Self-Inspection Handbook, Stage I & II Vapor Recovery for Gasoline Facilities as well as other fact sheets, instructional videos and copies of Part 230.  To obtain any of these materials, see the link to their website below.   
 
The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation can provide information on who must comply with the requirements set forth in Part 230, as well as an approved list of equipment required for use at facilities in New York utilizing vapor recovery.

3281,Laboratory Facilities,"Accurate laboratory test results are essential to health assessment and disease or environmental exposure prevention. The NYS Department of Health, Wadsworth Center's quality and regulatory oversight programs assure the development and implementation of methods that provide accurate, reliable, reproducible test results from clinical specimens or samples collected from the environment. These programs include issuance of operating licenses to clinical laboratories, environmental testing laboratories and human tissue banks for transplantation and research. 

Clinical Laboratory Permit:  Allows a facility to accept specimens for the microbiological, immunological, chemical, hematological, biophysical, cytological, pathological, genetic, or other examination of materials derived from the human body, for the purpose of obtaining information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease; the assessment of a health condition; or for identification purposes. Such examinations shall include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the presence or absence of various substances, components or organisms in the human body. This means that any facility issuing patient-identified results, including facilities performing research, clinical trials, insurance testing, forensic toxicology or forensic/paternity identity testing, excluding some exceptions, must hold a permit as a Clinical Laboratory.  All clinical laboratories that accept clinical specimens obtained in New York State must hold a New York State Clinical Laboratory Permit.  A clinical laboratory may operate one or more collecting or transfer stations with prior written approval from the NYS Department of Health.  

Blood Bank Permit:  A facility that collects, processes, fully tests, stores and/or distributes human blood, blood components or blood derivatives for transfusions and performs pre-transfusion tests must hold a Blood Bank Permit.  Non-hospital based facilities performing transfusions on-site that do not meet these criteria may apply for a designation as a Limited Transfusion Service.  All blood banks that accept clinical specimens obtained in New York State must hold a New York State Blood Bank Permit.

Blood bank laboratories performing immunohematology testing that includes blood typing for such groups as ABO and Rh, and cross matching, serving New York State patients must hold a permit in the category of Immunohmetology.  For further information on this requirement, contact the NYS Department of Health, Immunohematology Proficiency Testing Program at the Wadsworth Center, or visit their website. 

When a clinical laboratory and/or a blood bank are on the same premises and are under the supervision of the same director, the clinical laboratory and blood bank are considered one laboratory.  

Limited Service Laboratory Registration:  A laboratory facility operating in New York or accepting specimens from New York that perform only tests classified under the Federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as Waived and/or Provider-Performed Microscopy Procedures (PPMP) may register for the designation as a Limited Service Laboratory.

3284,Nonprofit Organizations,"There is no difference between the terms nonprofit and not-for-profit.  They both refer to an organization established for purposes other than profit-making or financial gain.  A nonprofit corporation is a special type of corporation organized for specific tax-exempt purposes. To qualify for nonprofit status, the corporation must be formed to benefit the public, a specific group of individuals, or the membership of the nonprofit organization.  Nonprofit corporations have the same limited liability protection that regular corporations and limited liability companies have. The directors, officers, members, and employees are not responsible for the debts and liabilities of the corporation.

Directors are responsible for the management and operations of the nonprofit corporation. Nonprofit directors can serve with or without compensation. If the directors are compensated, the compensation must be deemed reasonable by the IRS.  New York State requires at least three directors be listed on the Certificate of Incorporation. The IRS also requires at least three directors when submitting a tax-exempt application.  Officers of a nonprofit corporation run the day-to-day activities. Every nonprofit corporation must have a president, treasurer and secretary.  Bylaws are the specifications of the overall structure and operation of the organization and include the rules or laws under which the organization operates. 

To begin the process to become a nonprofit corporation, the organization must file with the NYS Department of State, Division of Corporations.  This filing does not automatically qualify the organization for federal and state tax-exemption. Only a validly organized nonprofit corporation can apply for federal and state tax-exemption.

FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

Every nonprofit organization that applies for federal tax-exempt status must have an employer identification number (EIN), whether or not it has employees.  To apply for an EIN, complete IRS Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number.  For more information about EINs, request IRS Publication 1635, Understanding Your EIN.

Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) exempts payment of federal income taxes for groups who are organized for charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competitions, or the prevention of cruelty to children or animals.  

To apply for exemption from federal income tax, request application Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code along and the IRS Publication 4220, Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, contains general guidelines for organizations that seek tax-exempt status from federal income tax.  The publication includes references to the statute, Treasury regulations, other IRS publication that explain the requirements for tax-exempt status, and IRS forms and instructions.  

The IRS takes approximately three to five months to examine and approve a 501(c)(3) application.  If all information submitted establishes that the organization meets the requirements for exemption, the IRS will issue a favorable ruling or determination letter recognizing the exemption.   

Generally, all tax-exempt organizations must file an annual information return.  Tax-exempt organizations that do not normally have annual gross receipts in excess of $25,000 are not required to file the annual information return.  However, starting in 2008, these organizations must submit an annual electronic notice using Form 990N, Electronic Notice (e-Postcard) for Tax-Exempt Organizations not Required to File Form 900 or 990-EZ, also known as the e-Postcard.  The e-Postcard can only be filed electronically; there is no paper version.  For more information, refer to IRS Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization.

3285,Pet Dealers,"Pet stores and breeders engaged in the sale of more than nine dogs or cats a year for a profit to the public require licensing through the NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets as a pet dealer.  Certain humane societies and breeders who sell, directly to the public, fewer than 25 animals per year that are born and raised at their residential premise are exempt from the pet dealer license.  The NYS General Business Law, Article 35-D outlines New York State's 'Pet Lemon Law' requirements.  This so-called Pet Lemon Law provides that if within 14 days of purchase, a veterinarian certifies that the animal was unfit due to illness, congenial malformation or infectious disease, the pet dealer must offer the consumer the right to choose one of the following options:  
 
(a) The right to return the animal and receive a refund of the purchase price and reasonable veterinary costs related to the certification that the animal was unfit;  
(b) The right to return the animal and receive an exchange animal of the consumer's choice and veterinary costs related to the certification; or  
(c) The right to keep the animal and receive reimbursement of the veterinary services for the purpose of attempting to cure the animal.  
 
The NYS Agriculture and Markets Law, Article 26-A outlines standards pet dealers need to follow for the care of animals.  There are standards on housing, sanitation, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care, daily exercise and humane euthanasia, as well as records retention.  Pet dealers are also required to provide certain types of documentation at the time of purchase of dogs or cats to the consumer.  Two types of documentation are a Disclosure of Animal Pedigree Registration and an Information Statement for Purchaser of a Dog or Cat; pet dealers can obtain copies of these forms by contacting the NYS Department of Agriculture and Market.  The NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets makes yearly inspections at pet dealer facilities.

Heating oil tanks less than 1,100 gallons are excluded from this registration requirement.  Facilities with a total combined storage capacity under 1,101 must register their oil tanks but there is no fee.  The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation requires petroleum bulk storage facilities to register every five years and to perform tightness tests on their storage tanks. This applies for both underground and aboveground storage tanks and includes out-of-service facilities until the facility is properly and permanently closed.  This petroleum tank registration requirement also satisfies compliance with 6 NYCRR Part 230 Vapor Recovery Requirements. 
 
Additionally, in July 2008 changes were made to the New York State law for the Petroleum Bulk Storage program to comply with the requirements mandated by the federal Energy Policy Act of 2005.  These changes include equipment requirements, delivery prohibition, and operator training. To obtain a copy of the NYS bulk storage regulations, contact your NYS Department of Environmental Conservation Regional Office or visit their website at www.dec.ny.gov.   All bulk storage facilities and petroleum storage tank owners are responsible for complying with the New York State bulk storage regulations.  The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation has delegated the petroleum bulk storage program to Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, and Westchester Counties.  Facilities located in these counties should contact the appropriate agencies listed below for information on regulations governing the registration of their facilities.

3288,Property Management Company,"Property and real estate managers are responsible for the day-to-day operations of property such as an office building, a shopping center, or an apartment complex. These managers are employed either directly by the owner or indirectly through a contract with a property management firm. Property managers perform a wide range of functions overseeing the performance of income-producing commercial or residential properties. They can oversee financial operations of the property, ensuring that mortgages, taxes, insurance premiums, payroll, and maintenance bills are paid on time. They can negotiate contracts for services such as: janitorial, security, grounds keeping, trash and snow removal. They can monitor the performance of contractors and investigate and resolve complaints from residents and tenants when services are not properly provided. Property managers purchase supplies and equipment for the property and make arrangements with specialists for repairs that cannot be handled by regular property maintenance staff. Property managers routinely inspect the grounds, facilities, and equipment to determine repairs or maintenance.

Property managers or firms who perform certain maintenance services may be required to register for NYS sales tax and collect sales tax on the charges for those services. Visit the Tax Department’s website through the links below (Publication 750, A Guide to Sales Tax in New York State, and Tax Bulletin TB-ST-129, Contractors—Repair, Maintenance, and Installation Services to Real Property (TB-ST-129)) for more information.

Property managers can work onsite or act as a liaison with the onsite manager and owner. Property managers may be required to live in apartment complexes where they work so that they are available to handle emergencies as they occur. Some property managers, called asset property managers, supervise the preparation of financial statements and periodically report to the owners on the status of the property, occupancy rates, dates of lease expiration, and other matters. 

Property managers should have a clear understanding of all federal, state, and local laws and regulations to comply with building, housing, health and safety codes. The NYS Attorney General's Office booklet, 'Tenant's Rights Guide,' available online through the link below contains information for both tenants and property owners/managers. Additionally, there are many federal, State, and local laws governing rental property that property managers should understand and comply with. Two federal laws are the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and the U.S. Federal Fair Housing Act. These laws can be reviewed through their respective links below. There are several New York laws governing rental property, some of these laws are: General Obligations Law, Real Property Law, Multiple Dwelling Law, and Multiple Residence Law. These laws can be reviewed in law libraries and in certain public libraries. The NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal administers the NYS Rent Stabilization Code and the Rent Regulation Reform Act. These codes limits the rent an owner may charge for an apartment and restricts the right of an owner to evict tenants. It also obligates the owner to provide essential services and equipment. For detailed information and requirements regarding rent stabilization, contact the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal office or visit the link below. 

Community association managers manage the common property and services of condominiums, cooperatives, and planned communities such as homeowners' or community associations.

3298,Wood Product Finishers and Refinishers,"The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation has revised its permitting rule, Part 201, in July 1996; it increased the number of exempt activities from 37 to over 100. Many small businesses are eligible for the new exemptions.

(The only exception to this is that exempt activities must be listed on Title V applications).  
 
If your eligibility for an exemption is based on the use of emission control equipment, you must properly operate and maintain the equipment. Other exemptions are based on material usage, which will require you to keep records on site that prove your exempt status for five years. You must also make these records available to DEC upon request.  
 
Note that your business may be exempt if located outside the New York City Metropolitan area and lower Orange County area and uses less than 25 gallons combined of coating materials (paints, stains, solvents, etc.) per month.

3299,Beer Production,"A brewery is a dedicated building for the brewing of beer.  A company that brews beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company.  The diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes, degrees of automation, and kinds of beer produced.  A brewery is typically divided into distinct sections, with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process.  There are several steps in the brewing process, which include malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging.  Key ingredients in the production of beer include water, starch source (such as barley), yeast and hops.

In New York, a brewer is any person or entity engaged primarily in the business to manufacture/produce and wholesale over 60,000 barrels of beer per year.  Licensing allows for the sale of beer from the premises of the beer brewed by the brewer to licensed wholesalers, retailers and permittees in New York, and to sell or deliver such beer to persons outside of New York according to the laws of the place of such sale or delivery. The license allows the brewer to sell beer at retail in bulk by the keg, cask or barrel for consumption.  

In New York, a micro-brewer is any person or entity engaged primarily in the business to manufacture/produce and wholesale under 60,000 barrels of beer per year.  The license allows the micro-brewer to sell beer in a sealed container for off-premises consumption at the New York State fair, at recognized county fairs and at farmers' markets operated on a not-for-profit basis.  

A person or entity licensed as a brewer in New York may request licensing to sell beer, wine or liquor at retail for consumption on the premises in a restaurant owned by him and conducted and operated by him in or adjacent to the brewery for which he is licensed.  Referred to as a ""brew pub"" license, this license allowed brewing of beer on-premises, as well as on-premises consumption of liquor, wine and beer.  The applicant can sell beer brewed on the premises to other retail licenses, where the license is held by the same person holding the restaurant-brewer license.  A person holding one or more licenses under this section may brew, no more than 20,000 barrels of beer a year.

A person or entity licensed as a brewer in New York may request licensing to sell beer, wine or liquor at retail for consumption on the premises in a restaurant owned by him and conducted and operated by him in or adjacent to the brewery for which he is licensed.  The license regulates the production and sale of beer for on and off premises consumption. This license is called a restaurant brewer or commonly referred to as a brew pub that is a bona fide restaurant that may produce up to 5,000 barrels of beer per location, not to exceed 20,000 barrels of beer per year.

The NYS Liquor Authority licenses brewers, microbrewers and restaurant brewers.  The NYS Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, Article 4, outlines the differences of each type of brewery along with other requirements.  For information on NYS Liquor Authority licensing requirements, contact the NYS Liquor Authority.  Other possible licenses from the NYS Liquor Authority may include brand labeling, wholesaling, beer tastings, outdoor events, and retail sales for off-premise consumption.

3301,Serving Alcoholic Beverages in New York,"In New York, bartenders and wait staff that sell, dispense, handle, or serve alcoholic beverages must be 18 years of age.  New York does not license bartenders or wait staff.  However, local government entities may have a required occupational license.  For information on whether an occupational license is required, contact the village, town, or city clerk's offices, as well as the county clerk's office.   
 
The NYS Liquor Authority has developed and established minimum criteria for alcohol training awareness programs.  The voluntary program recommends owners of establishments enact a serving policy to prevent the delivery of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person, as well as deterring the over consumption of alcoholic beverages by their patrons.  Bartenders and wait staff should receive the necessary knowledge and techniques needed to be responsible servers of alcohol.  This voluntary program provides information on how to protect servers and establishments from liability, how alcohol affects customers, how to recognize the effects of alcohol on customers, how to prevent a customer from becoming intoxicated, how to intervene when you need to refuse a sale, how to prevent and deal with disturbances, and how to accurately check IDs and recognize minors.   
 
The NYS Liquor Authority regularly conducts information and training seminars to insure compliance with the Alcohol Beverage Control Law.  The Program also established that trade schools and other entities, such as trade associations, can administer Alcohol Training Awareness Programs (ATAP).   An approved ATAP provider will issue a certificate of completion after successful completion of the program.  For a listing of Certified Alcohol Training Awareness Programs, visit the NYS Liquor Authority's website.  New York State requires that trade schools be licensed.

3302,Underwater Logging Operations,"Underwater logging is the salvaging of logs that loggers have abandoned after they became waterlogged and sank.  A related form of logging is the process of logging trees from underwater forests.  When artificial reservoirs and dams are built, large areas of forest are often inundated; although the trees die, the wood is often preserved.  The trees can then be felled using special underwater machinery and floated up to the surface.   

New York State and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers use the Joint Application Form for all projects, including underwater logging operations that affect streams, waterways, water bodies, wetlands, coastal areas and sources of water supply as well as projects located within or along the Adirondack Park, St. Lawrence River and the New York State Canals and canal reservoirs.  The Joint Application Form is used to seek permits and determinations for activities from certain New York State agencies as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that are mainly involved in licensing and permitting of underwater logging activities.  
 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers uses the Joint Application Form to seek approvals for activities affecting the Waters of the United States, including navigable waters and their tributaries, and associated wetlands, coastal areas and sources of water supply.  If you have a project that involves either the placement of dredged or fill material into any waters of the United States, or the performance of any work or placement of any structure into or affecting any navigable water, then you will need authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to beginning the project.  For more information on the U.S. Corps of Engineers Regulatory Program, the Joint Application Form requirements, and for district office contact information, visit their website.  

The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation requires the Joint Application Form to seek approvals for licensing requirements that may affect streams and navigable waters as well as other activities in and around waters in New York.  For licensing information, contact the regional office near the location of operation.  To find a listing of regional offices, visit the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's website.  Other possible DEC permit requirements may include the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and Article 15 – Protection of Waters permit.  For information on SEQRA see the links provided below.

The NYS Office of General Services requires the Joint Application Form to seek approvals for easements or permits to undertake activities affecting New York State owned underwater lands.  For licensing information contact the NYS Office of General Services, Real Estate Development, Bureau of Land Management at their website or by telephone.

The NYS Department of State requires the Joint Application Form for a determination of Coastal Consistency Concurrence for activities in or affecting the New York State Coastal Zone.  Activities requiring U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits or approvals must be determined to be consistent with the policies of the NYS Coastal Management Program and with the State approved Local Waterfront Revitalization Programs before the U.S. Army Corps permit is approved.  For information on consistency reviews by the NYS Department of State, Division of Coastal Resource, visit their website or contact their office by telephone.

3322,Independent Contractor OR Employee,"When determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor, there are vital distinctions to consider for both unemployment insurance (UI) and federal tax purposes. A person is an employee if they perform services under the supervision, direction and control of the employer. The direction would include specifications as to where, when and how the work is performed, as well as the final product. It is not necessary for the employer to exercise such control for the individual to be considered an employee; it is only necessary that the employer has the right to do so. Employers use IRS Form W-2 to report wages, tips and other compensation paid to an employee. 
 
Conversely, independent contractors do not perform services under the supervision, direction and control of the employer, are often in business for themselves, and offer their services to the general public. IRS Form-1099–Misc, Miscellaneous Income, is usually issued to independent contractors to report payments made to them for their services. No taxes are withheld from monies paid. 
  
For more information as to whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor, contact the NYS Department of Labor, Liability and Determination Section or visit their website. The Internal Revenue Service also provides information regarding the distinctions between employees and independent contractors.

3328,Employer Information,"If you hire staff for your business, New York as well as the Federal government have rules and regulations that you must follow.  Listed below are some topics all employers should be aware of:

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OR EMPLOYEE

When determining whether an individual is an employer or an independent contractor, there are vital distinctions to consider for both unemployment insurance and federal tax purposes.  A person is an employee if they perform services under the supervision, direction and control of the employer.  The direction would include specifications as to where, when and how the work is performed, as well as the final product.  It is not necessary for the employer to exercise such control for the individual to be considered an employee; it is only necessary that the employer has the right to do so.  Employers use IRS Form W-2 to report wages, tips and other compensation paid to an employee.

Conversely, independent contractors do not perform services under the supervision, direction and control of the employer, are often in business for themselves, and offer their services to the general public.  IRS Form-1099–Misc, Miscellaneous Income, is usually issued to independent contractors to report payments made to them for their services.  No taxes are withheld from monies paid. 

For more information as to whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor, contact the NYS Department of Labor, Liability and Determination Section or visit their website. The Internal Revenue Service also provides information regarding the distinctions between employees and independent contractors.  Form SS-8, Determination of Employees Work Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding, and Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide, are linked below.

CORPORATE OFFICERS

For unemployment insurance (UI) purposes corporate officers and stockholders who perform services for the corporation are employees. Any payment they receive for such services is remuneration and is reportable and subject to contribution.

EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION (FORM I-9)

The Immigration Reform and Control Act made all U.S. employers responsible to verify the employment eligibility and identity of all employees hired to work in the United States.  Employers must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification form (Form I-9) for all employees, including U.S. citizens.  I-9 forms are not filed with the U.S. government.  Employers must maintain I-9 records in their files for three years after the date of hire or one year after the date the employee's termination of employment. Employers must produce these documents upon inspections within three days.  For more information, contact the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service  or visit their website.  The I-9 Form is linked below.

NYS GUIDE FOR EMPLOYERS

Employer's Guide to Unemployment Insurance, Wage Reporting, and Withholding Tax (NYS50) is a complete guide that describes to employers how to comply with unemployment insurance contribution, wage reporting, and withholding tax obligations (including New York City and Yonkers). It explains employer rights, responsibilities, filing requirements, and reporting new or rehired employees.   For more information, contact the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance or visit their website.  The NYS-50 Publication link is below. 

PAYMENT OF WAGES

An employer's obligation to pay wages to his employees is defined in Article 6 of the NYS Labor Law.  The frequency of payment of wages depends on the classification of the employee.  Employers are required to maintain payroll records showing the hours worked, gross wages, payroll deductions and net wages for each employee and must furnish this information to employees with every payment of wages.  No deductions may be made from wages paid to an employee except those required by law, government rules and regulations, and which are expressly authorized, in writing, b",https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3328,Employer Information

3330,"Hotel, Motel, and Resort Operations","Hotel operators must collect sales tax on the room rate or rental charge for hotel occupancy, unless the charge is $2.00 or less per day. A room remarketer (such as an Internet travel site) is considered to be a hotel operator and must collect sales tax on the charge to its customers for hotel occupancy. 

Hotel occupancy is the use, or right to use, a room in a hotel. The term hotel includes hotels, motels, inns, and bed and breakfast establishments.

Room rate or rental charge is the amount that guests must pay to stay in the hotel room (or to have the right to use the hotel room). This amount is taxable at the full state and local sales tax rate.

Hotels in New York City:
Hotels in New York City must charge an additional hotel unit fee of $1.50 per unit per day, in addition to the state and local sales taxes on hotel occupancy.

If operating within the five boroughs of New York City (New York, Bronx, Kings, Richmond or Queens counties), contact the NYC Department of Buildings and NYC Department of City Planning or visit their websites.

Local occupancy:
Certain localities, such as counties, cities, and towns, charge an additional tax on hotel occupancy, commonly known as a bed tax. A bed tax must be shown as a separate charge on a customer’s bill. This tax is not administered by New York State and any questions regarding this tax should be directed to your local taxing jurisdiction.

Licensed accounting professionals, called certified public accountants or public accountants, prepare, evaluate, and attest to the accuracy and completeness of financial statements and related information. The term public typically refers to third-party reliance on the integrity of the financial information presented by the licensed accountant.  Certified Public Accountant and Public Accountant are titles which may only be used by those who are licensed by the Board of Regents to offer public accounting services in New York.  While certified public accountants (CPAs) and public accountants (PAs) are both licensed to perform the same public accounting services, they prepare differently to become licensed.  The title accountant by itself is not limited in New York State.

A firm that engages in the practice of public accountancy or uses the title CPA or CPA Firm or the title PA or PA Firm is required to register with the NYS Education Department.

CPAs and PAs provide financial services, including the following:

Accounting and Auditing Services:  Licensed accountants develop financial books and records and prepare financial statements. These statements are used by owners, investors, and others to determine the financial position and operating results of an organization. Third parties, such as banks, use financial statements audited, reviewed or compiled by licensed CPAs or PAs who are independent of the organization whose records are being evaluated. 

Tax Services:  Licensed accountants prepare tax returns, advise on tax issues and planning, and may represent clients before taxing authorities such as the Internal Revenue Service. Attorneys and individuals who are registered with the IRS as enrolled agents may also represent clients before the IRS. 

Management Advisory Services:  Licensed accountants analyze, evaluate, design, and implement the systems that affect the planning, organizing, and controlling of business activities. These services also include assisting clients on business transactions (e.g., mergers and acquisitions) and offering expert testimony in legal proceedings. Some licensed accountants provide personal financial planning services as well.

3394,Cigarettes or Tobacco Products Sales,"New York's Youth Access Tobacco Control laws were enacted to help stop the sale of tobacco products and herbal cigarettes to anyone under 18 years of age.  Enforcement officers routinely visit businesses that sell tobacco to determine if they are in compliance with the law.  The local designated enforcement officer works for the state, county or New York City Department of Health.  Some local governments have enacted local laws regulating the sale of tobacco, herbal or electronic cigarettes.  In these cases, the stricter law (state or local) must be followed. ""Electronic Cigarettes"" or ""e-cigarettes"" means a battery-operated device that contains cartridges filled with a combination of nicotine, flavor and chemicals that are turned into vapor which is inhaled by the user.

Copyrights do not protect facts, ideas, titles, names, short phrases, slogans, systems, or methods of operation. Copyright protection starts the moment the original work is created and fixed in a tangible form so that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. This protection is available to both published and unpublished works. A copyright generally gives the owner of the copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following: reproduce the work; prepare derivative works based upon the work; distribute copies or phone records of the work; perform and/or display the work publicly; and in the case of sound recordings, perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.

Registration of the original work is recommended with the U.S. Copyright Office but is not a requirement. Registration establishes a public record; gives prima facie evidence in a court of law if registered within five years of publication; may help with statutory damages and attorney's fee in court actions; and gives protection with the U.S. Customs Service against importation of infringing copies. A copyright registration is effective on the date the U.S. Copyright Office receives all the required elements. The U.S. Copyright Office recommends submitting the registration by registered or certified mail and to request a return receipt. Normal processing time takes approximately five to six months.

3400,Bed and Breakfast,"A bed and breakfast is a private home, occupied by the owner or manager, to provide overnight lodging accommodations and a morning meal for several people.  A bed and breakfast often has one to four bedrooms available for guests who share the house with the owners.  A bed and breakfast inn is often a larger operation with five to twenty rooms (or more) for guests; the owner or manager generally lives in a separate and more private section of the house.  Often an inn serves other meals in addition to breakfast and may serve meals to customers who are not using the lodging portion of the business.

To achieve the high standards needed to accomplish the requirements of a host, you will need to accommodate the expectations of your guests along with health and safety regulations.  To keep the integrity of your home and business, use the following as a guideline for success:

REGULATIONS:

A New York State license is required through the County Health Department if the bed and breakfast has a maximum occupancy of more than nine people.  Statewide fire codes or local ordinances may apply in the municipality.  Check with the local building code officials.  Make sure you have working smoke alarms and clearly identified exits whether or not the code applies.  Fire extinguishers should be in conspicuous places throughout your home, particularly in the areas occupied by guests.  Check with local town or village officials to assure that your home is zoned to do this type of a business.  

Food Service:  Depending on whether you are operating a bed and breakfast home or a bed and breakfast inn, you will either use your domestic kitchen with some modifications or need a licensed food service kitchen facility.  Check with your local County Health Department to determine your specific kitchen facility requirements.  While you need to create a sense of hospitality at breakfast, it is not necessary to provide elaborate meals.  Offer only a couple of options each day.

BED AND BREAKFAST FACILITIES:  As you evaluate your home or other property for use as a bed and breakfast take into consideration some of the following design elements:

1.  The number of bedrooms is generally 1 to 4 for a bed and breakfast home whereas a bed and breakfast inn can be up to 20 rooms or more.
2.  Bathrooms can be private within each guest room or shared with a few other guests but it is not recommended that the bed and breakfast owner's family and guests share the same bathroom.
3.  The dining area should be able to seat all your guests at the same time to allow for efficiency in cooking and serving breakfast each morning.
4.  The kitchen facilities should allow you to prepare breakfast for all guests at the same time while maintaining the health and safety standards appropriate for your full breakfast or continental-style menu.
5.  Determine if your laundry area and equipment are adequate for the daily linen changes of all your guest rooms and bathrooms.
6.  Maintain some privacy for your family and guests so each can get away from their bedrooms into a family or guest sitting room and read, talk, watch TV or just sit quietly and relax.
7.  Review the utilities within your building with licensed craftspersons as well as health, fire and building code enforcement officials in your area.
8.  Determine if on-street and/or off-street parking is adequate and safe for the number of guests you expect to serve each day.
9.  Check your sidewalks, parking areas, and steps to make sure that all are in good repair and well lighted at night for safe walking.
10.  Obtain all necessary safety equipment such as smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and fire extinguishers.

GENERAL INFORMATION:

Courtesy and Hospitality:  Courteous and friendly customer relations are essential ingredients in providing a sense of satisfaction to customers.

The NYS Department of Labor maintains a registration database with businesses registered as contractors or manufacturers. A garment contractor or manufacturer that fails to register is breaking state law and is considered a sweatshop operation. The NYS Department of Labor also recommends that you ask a contractor whether your order may be subcontracted out. If so, there is a chance that sweatshop labor might be used at some point in production and the garment produced may be considered 'unlawfully manufactured.' 

The NYS Department of Labor's Apparel Industry Task Force conducts monthly seminars for manufacturers, contractors, retailers and business groups to help raise working standards and strengthen voluntary compliance with state and federal laws.

3423,"Apostille or Certificate of Authentication
 (Authentication of Public Documents)","If you wish to use a certified document from New York State in a foreign country, you will need to have the document authenticated. This authentication certifies the signature on the document and the capacity of the official who has executed the document. The authentication may also validate the seal of the official.

The New York Secretary of State authenticates public documents for use in foreign countries. Only public documents that were issued in New York State and signed by either a State Official or a County Clerk can be authenticated. 

There are two types of authentication that can used in foreign countries: ""Apostille"" and ""Certificates of Authentication."" Countries that use the Apostille authentication have signed the 1961 Hague Convention abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents. Countries that are not members of the 1961 Hague Convention require a Certificate of Authentication.

An Apostille or Certificate of Authentication is issued by the New York Secretary of State through the Department of State. It is a one-page document with a blue laser printed facsimile of the New York Department of State Seal. Both the Apostille and Certificate of Authentication include the facsimile signature of the New York Secretary of State or his/her deputy.

To learn which countries follow the Hague Convention, please see the link to the list of signatory countries below. If the country in which you wish to use the document is listed, you can use an Apostille. If it is not, you should obtain a Certificate of Authentication.

Apostille:
The 1961 Hague Convention established Apostille guidelines. The Convention provides for the simplified certification of public (including notarized) documents to be used in countries that have joined the convention. Under the Hague Convention, signatory countries have agreed to recognize public documents issued by other signatory countries if those public documents are authenticated by the attachment of an internationally recognized form of authentication known as an Apostille. The Apostille ensures that public documents issued in one signatory country will be recognized as valid in another signatory country.

Certificate of Authentication:
For countries that do not accept the Apostille certification, you need a Certificate of Authentication. The New York Secretary of State issues Certificates of Authentication to authenticate public documents for use in any country that is not a member of the 1961 Hague Convention. In some cases, Certificates of Authentication may require an additional certification from the United States Department of State prior to submission to the foreign country (See the link below).

Obtaining and Preparing Documents for Authentication:

Vital Records
To obtain Birth, Death, Marriage or Divorce Records (vital records), you should make a request to the original office where the document was filed. To determine the appropriate office to obtain the vital record we suggest you refer to the New York State Department of Health web page on vital records at the link below.

Birth, Death, Marriage and Certificate of Divorce certificates submitted to the New York Department of State for an Apostille or Certificate of Authentication must first be certified by either a New York State Official or a County Clerk. The Department of State will not issue Apostilles/Certificates of Authentication without this certification.

Please Note: Birth and death certificates issued from the New York City Department of Health will also require a Letter of Exemplification. Therefore, you must request a Letter of Exemplification when requesting a birth or death certificate. Both the birth or death certificate and the Letter of Exemplification must be certified by the New York County Clerk prior to submission to the New York Department of State.
